# hardcover

This repositories name comes from the fact that hardcovers have a bit of an uplifting feel to them.

One day, I realized. I realized that when I write in a hardcover notebook, I am somewhat taller than I am when I write in a hardcover notebook.
I prepared this repositories for two reasons.
As a reminder for myself, and To train myself to write documents that others can easily understand.
I will put the documents in the memos directory for the former and in the contents directory for the latter.

If I understood the situation at hand and what I was learning,
I would be able to write in an easy-to-understand manner, using examples.
In the process of growing a little taller than I am now and putting many events into words,
I will attempt to grow and provide better value.
